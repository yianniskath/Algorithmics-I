# Algorithmics-I
This is the code I have written for the Algorithmics I course for my second year as a Computer Science student. 

The exercise was asking us to implement a word ladder algorothm as well as dijkstra's shortest path. 
You can run each algorithm by compiling the Main.java file
and later on running the command:

java Main words5.txt word1 word2

word1 and word2 are two words that can be found in the words5.txt file for which the algorithm will run on.
The report for the assigment can also be seen here, the word ladder algorithm works just fine, the dijkstra algorithm though had
some unresolved flaws.
